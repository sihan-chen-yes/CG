(Note: please read the [supplementary](#supplementary) section first before working on this report.)

# Part 1: Dielectric BSDF
**Time spent on this task:** 3hours

**Describe your implementation of `Dielectric` class.**
Should consider the case transmit from interior or exterior, change normal direction and relative IOR correspondingly.
Then compute the fresnel coefficient, and use it as event probability to choose between reflection and refraction.
Remember to set needed properties of `bRec`. Use the coefficient to compute the bsdf value(including cos term and pdf,
these to terms cancel with the raw bsdf value). Be careful with the pdf, need to consider the event probability as well inside.
# Part 2: Path Tracing

## BSDF Sampling
**Time spent on this task:** 3hours

**Describe your implementation of `path_mats`.**
Following the decomposition of $L_o$, we can accumulate the bsdf(with cos and pdf term weighted) as throughput, and
evaluate the radiance from emitter(self-emission from next bounce), then accumulate the production of them. Use Russian
Roulette to terminate the loop. And when evaluate the radiance from emitter, we could do bsdf sampling(if hit the emitter then non-zero radiance).
We could also reuse the path for NEE instead of sample another one, in this situation, we just need to store the direction
sampled when calculating the radiance, and also accumulate the throughput coefficient for next bounce use.

According to the slides, we could do Russian Roulette only after 3 bounces for less noise.

Besides, actually there are two ways of writing the code, the difference is if including the first radiance evaluation
into the loop code, like the difference of `while()` and `do {} while()`.
Use the first one for easier understanding, and the second one for more compact code. But the pseudo code is written
in both two ways, which is pretty confusing. (path tracing for the first one, photon tracing for the second one)

I used `do{} while()` style format for compact code, following the photon tracing pseudo code.

## Multiple Importance Sampling
**Time spent on this task:** 3hours

**Describe your implementation of `path_mis`.**
Almost the same as Mats path tracing, but use multi-importance sampling when evaluate the radiance. Calculate the
`weight_ems` and `weight_mats` using `pdf_ems` and `pdf_mats`, then use the weight to control the contribution of each
strategy. And also we could reuse the bsdf sampling path and only do Russian Roulette after 3 bounces.

Ensure the `pdf_ems` and `pdf_mats` are from the same intersection point.

Careful with handling the corner case:

For the `weight_ems`: if the `pdf_ems` from `eval()` is 0 and pdf from `lRec` is 1,
then that's the discrete emitter case(like pointlight, although didn't show up in the scene of PA4), set `weight_ems` to 1.
We can't only use `pdf_ems` from `eval()` equals 0 to directly do the branch(due to another case of failed sampling is also with `eval()` equaling 0.
Excluding the discrete case, then detect if the pdf from `lRec` is non-zero, if no, that's failed sampling case, just set `weight_ems` as 0.

For `weight_mats`: also first exclude discrete cases(set `weight_mats` to 1) using the measure type, then go check the pdf,
0 means failed sampling, directly set `weight_mats` as 0.

This method could handle every cases well as far as I know.

I followed the pseudo code with `while()` style for easier understanding(special handling the first ray).

Seems mine has more noise, and the color distribution is very similar.

Got more noises near on the glass surface, also for photon mapping. Suppose it's due to the dielectrics material. After interact with this material($bsdf <= 1$),
it got a bigger probability to terminate, which leads noise. If increase to 10 instead of 3(forcing bouncing), there are even less noise than ref.
# Part 3: Photon Mapping
**Time spent on this task:** 4 hours

## Photon Emission from Shape Area Lights
**Describe your implementation of `AreaEmitter::samplePhoton(...)`.**
According to the formula, $\Phi_p=\frac{\Phi}{M}$ and $\Phi = \pi \times A \times L$, assuming the uniform sampling on
the mesh surface, we could return flux per photon(return total photon in code). And remember to
set the ray with origin and direction(cosine weighted direction sampling).

## Photon Tracing and Storage
**Describe your implementation of `PhotonMapper::preprocess(...)`.**

Following the pseudo code, each time sampling an emitter randomly and generate the photon, remember to update the ray(update dRcp)
after filling in the properties, and consider the pdf of emitter sampling into flux(radiance) as well. Then use bsdf sampling
to bounce, and use Russian Roulette to terminate(after 3 bounces). If hit the surface with diffuse bsdf, then store the
photon information including direction, flux and intersection point. Then build the KDTree(code given).

Careful with the `m_photonCount` property, which is the size of the KDTree, not the emitted photon count. `phi_p` should
come from the total flux and the emitted photon count.

## Rendering/Radiance Estimation
**Describe your implementation of `PhotonMapper::Li(...)`.**
Following the `do{} while()` style of path bsdf tracing. Apart from terminating according to Russian Roulette, we
could terminate if hit a surface with diffuse bsdf(because we already stored the biased reflection radiance via photon).
For photon radiance, query the KDTree to get all the photons in the radius, evaluate the bsdf value(without cosine and pdf term),
and do production with photon irradiance, and average all production as reflection radiance.

If increase the number of emitted photons, the splotches will decrease.

# Feedback

Pseudo code style should be unified, I guess the pseudo code in the slides are from two different TAs.
