# Part 1: Light Sampling

## Integrator Implementation
**Time spent on this task:** 60min

**Describe your implementation of `direct_ems`.**

First do scene hit detection. Then consider the hit point, if it is emitter itself, then add self emission into outgoing
radiance. Then instead of iterate all the emitters, just uniformly sample an emitter(according to provided code). Then
sample this single emitter to get light source point, finally use MC to do integration, $p_{em}(w_i^k)$ is included in
radiance(from sample method) already. Use `bRec` to query the bsdf value, and consider the uniform sampling strategy on
emitters, $p_{em}(w_i^k)$ should multiply $\frac{1}{emitter \, cnt}$, which is the same as multiply the number of emitters.

Difficulty: didn't consider the scene hit point is emitter itself, which leads dark of light source.
## Shape Area Light
**Time spent on this task:** 60min

**Describe your implementation of `AreaEmitter::eval(...)`.**

Because the area emitter emits radiance uniformly in all directions from each points of the mesh. So just return the
radiance simply if intersections are in the front(same side with normal), otherwise return 0.

**Describe your implementation of `AreaEmitter::pdf(...)` and `AreaEmitter::sample(...)`.**

pdf: it's easier to do uniform area sampling directly(using `sRec`, filling in the properties before using), and then
transform the pdf in area unit to pdf in solid angle unit, with formula $p_w = \frac{d^2}{cos\theta} p_y$.

sample: construct `sRec` to evaluate the value and the pdf, then check the pdf value, if it's 0, then return 0,
otherwise return the division between them.

Difficulty: corner case handling. If `wi` and `n` is perpendicular, should return 0 as pdf and value, we could include
this situation as back intersections.

# Part 2: BRDF Sampling

## Integrator Implementation
**Time spent on this task:** 90min

**Describe your implementation of `direct_mats`.**
Completely same as samping emitters at first if the scene hit point is emitter itself, directly query and add into the
outgoing radiance, then sample the bsdf to get `bRec`(direction is contained), use it to construct the `eRec` to
evaluate the radiance value if hit with emitter, then do MC integration finally.

Difficulty: not only $p_{mat}(w_i^k)$ but also cosine term is included, and `bRec` is constructed with local frame while
`eRec` is contructed with world frame. Hope shadow ray to intersect with scene to get radiance! And the convention of
`wi` and `wo` is different when construction.

## Microfacet BRDF
**Time spent on this task:** 90min

**Describe your implementation of `Microfacet::eval(...)`.**
Return 0 if intersects at back or if the measure is not `ESolidAngle` just like `diffuse.cpp`, calculate the half way
vector `wh`, and return the brdf value obtained from formula(combination of diffuse and specular components brdf).

**Describe your implementation of `Microfacet::sample(...)`.**
Return 0 if intersects at back, otherwise use two strategies to sample brdf. The first is via specular component,
sample `wh` with Beckmann distribution to construct `bRec` if random seed is less than `ks`(coeff `ks` corresponds with
the pdf of this strategy), the second is via diffuse component, sample `wo` with cosine weighted distribution if
random seed is bigger than `ks`. Then use the `bRec` to query the linear blending of two pdfs coming from respective
strategies. Then return the division(remember to check the queried pdf).

Difficulty: remember to add cosine term when returning, and use the random seed repeatedly,
and stretch back to [0, 1] before using.

# Part 3: Multiple Importance Sampling
## Integrator Implementation
**Time spent on this task:** 120min

**Describe your implementation of `direct_mis`.**

Almost just combination of `ems` and `mats`, first consider the self emission from emitter as before. And then do
emitter sampling and get the pdf(need to multiply the uniform probability of happened to sample that emitter), then
do as `ems`, but need to evaluate $p_{mat}(w_{i,e}^k)$, use the two pdfs to calculate heuristic weight. Then the same
for bsdf sampling as well, evaluate $p_{em}(w_{i, m}^k)$ and $p_{mat}(w_{i, m}^k)$ and calculate weight, finally use the
weights to linear blending respective radiance to return.

Difficulty:
1. $p_{em}(w_{i}^k)$ need consider the probability of uniform sampling of light
2. $p_{mat}(w_{i, m}^k)$ may be 0(for discrete measure, pdf is set to 0), then ignore weight(use weight 1) to keep the lambertian radiance, same for $p_{em}(w_{i, e}^k)$
