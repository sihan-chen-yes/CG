# Part 1: Normal Integrator
**Time spent on this task:** 10min

**Describe your implementation of Normal Integrator.**
Given scene and ray, detect the intersections. If not intersect, set the shading color as black, other wise use the
shading normals as shading color.
Because the range is between -1 to 1. Just simply use absolute value of shading normals(from 0 to 1).

**Problem:**
I used the implementation from introduction, but this method map two normals to one shading color.
It should directly map $([-1,1] + 1) \times 0.5$ to $[0, 1]$

# Part 2: Non-Physical Integrators

## Average Visibility Integrator
**Time spent on this task:** 30min

**Describe your implementation of this integrator.**
Like the normal integrator, first detect the intersection of primary ray, if intersects, then return 0(not visible),
otherwise return 1(visible), then sample a new direction at the intersections using uniform hemisphere sampling.
Then shoot the secondary ray, detect the intersections as well, do the same as well. Remember using the
low threshold(Epsilon not 0) of rays when constructing rays!

## Material Preview Integrator
**Time spent on this task:** 40min

**Describe your implementation of this integrator.**
First detect the intersections(if not return 0), then transform ray direction from world frame to
local frame(should flip direction according to convention). Then build bsdf query record with incident and fixed
outgoing ray $(0,0,1)$, remember using `EMeasure::ESolidAngle`. Finally, get bsdf function
from mesh, plug in bsdf record to evaluate corresponding values and return.

# Part 3: Analytic Sphere Shape
**Time spent on this task:** 90min

**Describe your implementation of Sphere and two functions.**
1.Sphere intersection: plugin ray equation into the sphere equation, then solve quadratic equation for roots.
Consider the determinant(3 situations) and roots(root should satisfy 3 conditions,
check each one iteratively from the smaller one until find answer).
2.Set hit information: Find intersection point first, set the normal(geo and sh are same for sphere),
turn the sphere coordinates(relative to sphere center!) into UV coordinate(should normalize to [0, 1] range).

# Part 4: Direct Illumination Integrator
**Time spent on this task:** 90min

**Describe your implementation of Direct Illumination Integrator.**

1.PointLight:
According to the formula, return $L_i$ in `sample` function, also fill in the fields of
`EmitterQueryRecord`, including `p`, `w_i`, `pdf`, `shadowRay`, remember to use `Epsilon` to handle numerical problems.

$$L_i = \frac{I}{d^2}$$

2.Direct illumination:
First detect intersections, if not, return 0 directly.
Then iterate emitters, use shadow rays(from sample function) to detect if there are intersections between ref point and light source. If not,
queried `L_i` from each light sources. Construct bsdf value as before(use local frames!),
then do an integration(according to the formula) to get the outgoing radience to camera.

$$
L_o(\mathbf{x}, \omega_o) = \int_{\Omega} L_i(\mathbf{x},\omega_i)\, f(\mathbf{x}, \omega_i, \omega_o)\, |\cos\theta_i|\, \mathrm{d}\omega_i
$$

# Part 5: Texture Mapping
**Time spent on this task:** 20min

**Describe your implementation of texture mapping.**
Essentially moving a checkerboard pattern in the range of $[0, 1]^2$ cube.
First, use the current UV coordinates to scale to get new UV indices according to the scale factors.
Second, move the origin in the new UV space.
Third, observe the pattern, list the indices, then find odd and even indices sum(floor rounding)
corresponds to `v1` and `v2` respectively

and give the main use for each function with comments like shape modelling and geometry processing course.

# Supplementary
* For each task, please note down the time you spent working through it and use at least a few sentences to describe your implementation. If applicable, also report the problems you encounter (e.g. whether or how it's solved, what is the difficult part).
